Hi! I'm Babis, a software engineer out of Athens, Greece. I'm polyglot and I have quite some experience with Java,
Python, C/C++ and recently Go.

I've been working in the telecommunications industry for more than 10 years and along that way I've picked up quite some
experience in networks.

I'm very interested in cloud infrastructure, modern application deployment methods, API first development and extracting
the power of development languages.

If you're interested, have a look in my public [Github](https://github.com/BabisK) repos and say "hi"
on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ckaidos)!
